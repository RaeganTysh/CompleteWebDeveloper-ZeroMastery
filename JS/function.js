//Closures
//funciton runs, function executes. I'ts never going to execute again but it's going to remember that there are references to those variables 
//so...child scope always has access to the parent scope variables
//children can access parent but parents can't access children! Ex name= Bobby

//Currying - (arrow = function) converting a funciton that multiple arguments to a function that takes them one at a time
//why?- more extensible
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
//this is a function inside of a function
const curriedMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
curriedMultiply(3);  // const curriedMultiply = (3) => (b) => 3 * b; //so it will return the second function
curriedMultiply(3) (4);     //to make it work need to give values to both functions
const multiplyBy5 = curriedMultiply(5);         //more extensible  //multiply any parameter givne by 5  (a=5, b=second parameter)

multiplyBy5(10);

//Compose - putting 2 functions together to form a 3rd functions
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
//f and g are functions
//example
const sum =(num) => num + 1
//ex f and g are sum and a =5
compose(sum, sum)(5);
//break it down
//const compose = (f, g) => (a) => sum(sum(5));
//const compose = (f, g) => (a) => sum(6));
//const compose = (f, g) => (a) => sum(6));

////avoid/minimise side effects (console.log and undefined values) 
//strive for functional purity - clean functions that return something (Deterministic- always returns the same value- avoid bugs)
var a =1;
function b() {
    a=2             //this is a side effect it's effecting a global variable instead of staying in scope

}


//Solve these problems:

//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters
const summation = (x) => (y) => x + y;
summation(5)(6);
//11

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3)
//13

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)
//31

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
add5(12)
//17

//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;          
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10)
//16


//What are the two elements of a pure function?
//1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
//2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
